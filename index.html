          <p class="lead"> Emma Whyte is an interior designer who’s website wasn’t fitting her image. She hired me to create a more modern interactive website that was more reflective of her work. Emma didn’t have any strict plan for what she wanted the whole website to look like so I had a lot of freedom to explore and to play around with the design of it.  I decided to go for something colourful and stylish to reflect on the products Emma makes. Click on the image to view the live website. </p>

          <p class="lead">For one of my modules in my first year of University, we were asked to recreate the book cover of George Orwells 1984. I did a lot of research into old book covers and into Orwell’s life and the message he wanted the book to deliver. For my book cover I wanted to encapsulate the theme of control, it communicates the harsh dystopia that Orwell created in the book. I used the colour red to link back to communist propaganda and the idea of power, and the black to show the bleak darkness of the novel. I learnt a lot through the process and came up with a lot of ideas and realised how development and learning from failures is a very important part of the design process.</p>

          <p class="lead">For another module in my first year we were asked to produce designs for a visually engaging information-based iPad app. We were given three different topics and I picked Life Predictor. After the initial planning process, I came up with the idea of creating an app that predicted roughly when a person may die and whether or not they would go to heaven or hell, this later became ‘Karma Clock’. I did a lot of research into heaven and hell and the beliefs of different religions and found the concept of Karma to be quite interesting, I decided that it could be a more entertaining concept for the app to show the user which animal they would be reincarnated as, due to their ‘Karma Points’ instead of the initial Heaven/Hell idea. I really enjoyed the whole design process and had a lot of fun with colours and drawings. I experimented with several colour schemes and fonts until I found the combination that looked the best. The final product looked very different to the initial wireframes and I was proud of what I created in the end.  </p>

          <p class="lead">For one of my first modules of second year we were asked to create and pitch a new product. We decided we wanted to design a piece of wearable emergency technology that would make the user feel safer when walking alone.  This later became ‘Hero’. For the design process I created the wireframes and final designs for both our jewellery items and our app. We went through several different jewellery ideas and settled with three basic colour options, gold, silver and black. I kept the designs for the jewellery simple to ensure that they would be suitable for any gender and age. When designing the app I wanted to ensure that it was very simple to use, not confusing and that it fulfilled its main function, which is to help people share their location and feel safe. I think we came out with an interesting final product that I feel would actually benefit people’s lives. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">VR Cityscape</h2>
          <p class="lead"> For the next module of my second year we were asked to develop an engaging realtime audiovisual experience. For this module we had to use three.js and 3D modelling, it was my first time using both of them. I decided that I wanted to create a 3D cityscape in VR. I had never used VR before so this came with its challenges. I had to do a lot of research into both three.js and VR to understand how I could code the project. After a lot of experimenting I was able to create a VR scene with my 3D model that I created on Maya and used photoshop to create my own textures. Initially, the user could view the whole scene from a fixed position but I decided that I wanted it to be more interactive so I included first person controls that enabled the user to fly around the scene. I faced challenges when it came to making the VR work on a mobile and laptop. Some functions that worked on a laptop browser would not have the same effect on the mobile. At the moment the VR scene on a mobile is still in the fixed position, the user cannot move forward, this is something that I would like to change and I’m sure with time and a better understanding of VR and three.js I will be able to change this. </p>

        <p class="text-center">I have always had a keen interest in technology and I am fascinated by how it is ever evolving. Through studying English Literature and Drama at Sixth Form,  my imagination has matured. English Literature deepened my understanding of how everyone sees things differently, I believe this is key to web design in ensuring inclusivity and celebration of diversity for intergenerational audiences. I am currently at Plymouth University studying Internet Design developing my coding and programming knowledge further and hope to one day show the world that women can also be very successful in what is currently a male led industry.  </p>
